# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES
Thank you for your interest in contributing to this font repository. This
section guides you on how to contribute smoothly and without any hiccups.




## Basic Requirements
Here are some of the basic requirements for a successful upload:



### 1. Organized in Directory
All font set shall be organized in its own directory, under the primary
categories. The directory name shall only contain alphanumeric characters and
dash (`-`) only.

You need to replace space (` `), underscore (`_`), and etc. into dash (`-`)
as per se.

> **NOTE**
>
> This naming convention only applies to the directory. The font file shall
> retain its originality alongside its name.



### 2. Include License
Each font set has its own license file. Please include it. If you can find the
original license file, do not upload it. The source of the file is needed for
reviewers to verify its legal compliances.

The font set must be compliant to
[Open Font License](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL)
as this repo only accepts this license compliance. When in doubt, do not
upstream.



### 3. Include README.md
Although not available by default, please make or include a README.md for that
font set and describe briefly about it. This allows us to understand the font
much better than opening other software to review it. Some compulsory content
would be:

1. Brief summary about the font
2. Downloaded source (where did the font sourced from)
3. List of designers (in full name, with their title if available)



### 4. Set Font File with `644` File Permission
For fonts to work on some Linux OS like Debian, all font files **MUST** be
set to `644` file permission. Otherwise, it won't work.
