# Nova Mono

I created the NovaCut font about 14-15 years ago for making inscriptions on
stone. Initially the font contained only capitals and digits and existed only on
paper and stone inscriptions. In 2010 I decided transfer this font to a
computer, and made the missing lowercase and some basical signs; it was
initially named Gothica.

By the way I made other versions of some letters. It was a lot of this at the
end of my work. I decided create new fonts based on these letters. And finally I
created six fonts family and named these fonts Nova (NovaCut, NovaFlat,
NovaOval, NovaRound, NovaSlim, NovaSquare - by the shape of individual fonts).
At last I created monospace font - NovaMono - the seventh part of this family.
