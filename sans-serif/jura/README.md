# Jura

Jura is a family of sans-serif fonts in the Eurostile vein. It was originally
inspired by some work I was doing for the FreeFont project in designing a Kayah
Li range for FreeMono. The Latin alphabet is using the same kinds of strokes and
curves as the Kayah Li glyphs, and thus Jura was born. It has been expanded to
include glyphs for the Cyrillic and Greek alphabets as well.

The original Kayah Li glyphs have been included in this font. Note that glyphs
for writing mainstream Burmese are not and never have been a part of this font.

The Jura family has an unfortunate name clash with Ed Merrittâ€™s Jura serif font.
