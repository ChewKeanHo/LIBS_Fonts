# Orbitron
Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes.
It features four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), stylistic
alternatives, small caps, and a ton of alternate glyphs. Orbitron was designed
so that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces
like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If youâ€™ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie,
you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the
apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric
typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage,
monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads,
etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies
portraying this inevitable future. It was initially published on the League of
Movable Type.

Orbitron was remastered as a variable font in 2019. To contribute updates or
