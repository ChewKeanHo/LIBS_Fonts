# Bubbler One
Bubbler One is an original font with thin strokes that are particularly
straight. It is a legible typeface in small sizes. You can use Bubbler One for
any kind of text, formal or informal, big or small; I hope you find it useful!

A Mincho (Japanese Serif) style font which has been drawn on a square grid. It
takes inspiration from Mincho's clean and well organized appearance and the
organic nature of handwritten letterforms.
