# Sulphur Point Typeface

Sulphur Point is a geometric sans serif typeface, with a low contrast stems,
high x-height, restrained ascenders and descenders and minimal optical
adjustments away from pure geometric form. The typeface is the result of an
exploration of theories of the political production of space as manifested in
the port and recreational marine facilities of Sulphur Point here in Tauranga,
New Zealand.

This font comes with three weights â€“ Light, Regular and Bold, contains uppercase
and lowercase letters, numerals and symbols, supports multilanguage. Sulphur
Point is intended for both display and copy use.  This font family looks great
for headlines as well as text blocks and suits for various graphic and web
design purposes.
