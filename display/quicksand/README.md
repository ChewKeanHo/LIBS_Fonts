# Quicksand

Quicksand is a display sans serif with rounded terminals. The project was
initiated by Andrew Paglinawan in 2008 using geometric shapes as a core
foundation. It is designed for display purposes but kept legible enough to use
in small sizes as well. In 2016, in collaboration with Andrew, it was thoroughly
revised by Thomas Jockin to improve the quality. In 2019, Mirko Velimirovic
converted the family into a variable font.
