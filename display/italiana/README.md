# Italiana

Italiana was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines.
Italiana is inspired by the calligraphy of the Italian masters. It is suitable
for design solutions that require elegance and sophistication. It was conceived
with modern proportions that make it great for economical typesetting both on
paper and on screen.

The Italiana family is in progress and is being regularly improved. If you have
a request, wish to contribute improvements or even fund specific features,
simply contact Santiago Orozco. You can follow Santiago on Twitter, @Typemade.
