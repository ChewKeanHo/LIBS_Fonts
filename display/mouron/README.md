# Mouron

Mouron is an art deco font inspired by works of A.M. Cassandre (Adolphe
Jean-Marie Mouron). He was a French painter, commercial poster artist and
typeface designer. Mouron typeface is a tribute to some of his commercial work
along with the Art Deco period. It is designed in two widths to create
interesting rhythm that would have been common in hand drawn typography during
Cassandreâ€™s time.
