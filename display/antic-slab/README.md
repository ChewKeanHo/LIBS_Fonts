# Antic Slab

Antic Slab was designed for use in the headlines of newspapers and magazines.
The Antic Type System is a super family that is still evolving, and this first
release of the Slab family. It complements the Sans and Didone versions, giving
the designer freedom to create rhythmic and dynamic typography using all three
families in the type system.

Each family in the type system has a large x-height that makes it very readable,
especially on the web. Each also has slight stress derived from handwriting.
Antic Slab's discreet slab serifs give it a strong presence in layouts. With
modern proportions and condensed letterforms, it is great for economical
typesetting, on paper and on screen.

The Antic Type System is in progress and is being regularly improved. If you
have a request, wish to contribute improvements or even fund specific features,
