# Abril Fatface

Abril Fatface is part of a bigger type family system, Abril, which
includes 18 styles for all Display and Text uses. The titling
weights are a contemporary revamp of classic Didone styles,
display both neutrality and strong presence on the page to attract
reader attention with measured tension by its curves, good color
and high contrast.

Abril Fatface in particular is inspired by the heavy titling fonts
used in advertising posters in 19th century Britain and France. The
thin serifs and clean curves lend the typeface a refined touch that
give any headline an elegant appearance. The Extended Latin character
set supports over 50 languages, including those from Central and
Northern Europe.
