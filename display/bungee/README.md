# Bungee

In the crowded urban environment, space for signage is always at a premium. From
dumpy liquor stores to majestic theaters, sometimes signs have nowhere to go but
up. Bungee is a font family that celebrates urban signage. It wrangles the Latin
alphabet to work vertically as well as horizontally.

Thanks to support from Google and The Font Bureau, Bungee is released under the
SIL Open Font License.

As a display superfamily, 5 variations are available:

Bungee
Bungee Hairline
Bungee Inline
Bungee Outline
Bungee Shade

USA. To contribute, see github.com/djrrb/Bungee
