# Vis-A-Vis

Vis-A-Vis is a decorative typeface, an Antiqua-like font, just divided in the
middle so that each half almost represents its own letters, which are just
opposite each other. So the name wasn't that distant either.

Vis-A-Vis comes in Regular and Bold weights, supports Latin, Greek and Cyrillic
languages.
