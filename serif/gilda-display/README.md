# Gilda Display

Gilda Display is a font of classic proportions, in which we can see the finest
treatment of curves, strokes and serifs. The high stroke contrast has especially
smooth transitions, making this type perfect for the world of fashion, jewelry
and luxury items. Gilda Display typically contributes all its glamor to
headlines, but the considered design of this font gives it potential for use in
longer texts with a fine page texture.

Since Junuary 2023, the glyphset is completed and and the font has a bigger
language support
