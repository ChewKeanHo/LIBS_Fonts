# Libre Bodoni
The Libre Bodoni fonts are based on the 19th century Morris Fuller Benton's ATF
design, but specifically adapted for today's web requirements. They are a
perfect choice for everything related to elegance, style, luxury and fashion.
Libre Bodoni currently features four styles: Regular, Italic, Bold and
Bold Italic.
